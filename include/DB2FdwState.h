/** DB2FdwState
 *  FDW-specific information for RelOptInfo.fdw_private and ForeignScanState.fdw_state.
 *  The same structure is used to hold information for query planning and execution.
 *  The structure is initialized during query planning and passed on to the execution
 *  step serialized as a List (see serializePlanData and deserializePlanData).
 *  For DML statements, the scan stage and the modify stage both hold an
 *  DB2FdwState, and the latter is initialized by copying the former (see copyPlanData).

   * obtained from extract_actual_join_clauses, which strips RestrictInfo
   * construct. So, for a join relation they are list of bare clauses.
